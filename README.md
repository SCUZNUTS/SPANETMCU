# SPANETMCU
SPANET Controller for NodeMCU

This code will connect via a nodemcu to the SPANET device with the RJ45 cable to PINs 5, 6, 7.
This will connect to your MQTT server to enable status of the SPA along with the ability to post commands to the SPA to control it.

It also has a WEB interface to control and status can be viewed and set directly.

Please someone make the HTML pretty as its not my specialty.

In the board folder is the gerber and pickandplace file which can be uploaded to jlcpcb.com for order (min order 5) but only cost $10 odd.

Also pictures of the competed unit.

Buck power module is here https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002603013499.html?spm=a2g0o.9042311.0.0.27424c4drMc5hr its the 5-40V to 5V unit
D1 Mini can be sourced from many places but here is ali link https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001621784437.html?spm=a2g0o.9042311.0.0.27424c4dxMODuD i used D1 Mini V3.0 but any would work, note the D1 mini pro can attached a booster arieal so may be a good option if your spa is a long way from your AP.
Note the 2 resistors are 330K resistors.
