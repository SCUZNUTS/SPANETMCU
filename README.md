# SPANETMCU
SPANET Controller for NodeMCU

This code will connect via a nodemcu to the SPANET device with the RJ45 cable to PINs 5, 6, 7.
This will connect to your MQTT server to enable status of the SPA along with the ability to post commands to the SPA to control it.

It also has a WEB interface to control and status can be viewed and set directly.

Please someone make the HTML pretty as its not my specialty.
